## Drumkit: Keystrokes are associated with different drum sounds
* Data attributes can be used to add information to HTML elements (in this case associating the keystroke with the corresponding sound file)
* Playing basic sounds with `<audio>` tags
* The `<kbd>` tag stylistically adds monospace, but can be useful for semantic meaning

## Clock: Analogue clock that updates in real time
* Create a circle using `border-radius: 50%`
* Consider the axis of rotation: move the axis to the end of the div to rotate around the end rather than the centre using `transform-origin`
* `setInterval` function to determine how often the clock updates
* Basic transitions including `transition-timing-function` to simulate proper movement of the seconds hand
